# AI Development Escapes

This document tracks bug fixes, issues, and "escapes" that were discovered and resolved during AI-assisted development of CassandraC. These are distinct from feature development costs and represent fixes to problems that escaped initial implementation.

## Escape Types

- **Test Escape**: Tests that failed after initial implementation
- **Code Escape**: Bugs discovered in working code
- **Integration Escape**: Issues found during system integration
- **Documentation Escape**: Errors or omissions in documentation

## Tracked Escapes

### Boolean Test Query Error
**Type**: Test Escape  
**Cost**: $0.15  
**Duration**: 3m 15s  
**Date**: Counter Types feature development session

**Issue**: 
- Boolean test `test_boolean_with_simple_queries` was failing with Cassandra filtering error
- Query used `WHERE id = 20 AND bool_val = true` which requires `ALLOW FILTERING`
- Error: "Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance"

**Root Cause**:
- Test attempted to filter by non-primary key column (`bool_val`) without `ALLOW FILTERING`
- Cassandra requires `ALLOW FILTERING` for queries that don't use only primary key columns
- Initial boolean test implementation didn't account for Cassandra's query restrictions

**Resolution**:
- Modified test to query by primary key only: `WHERE id = 20`
- Verify boolean values in returned results instead of filtering by them
- Maintains same test coverage without requiring filtering
- All 62 tests now pass (was 61 passing, 1 error)

**Prevention**:
- Future tests should be designed with Cassandra's query limitations in mind
- Primary key-only queries for verification when possible
- Consider adding Cassandra query pattern guidelines to CLAUDE.md

### Missing DECIMAL Type Implementation
**Type**: Code Escape  
**Cost**: TBD  
**Duration**: TBD  
**Date**: Decimal/Floating Point Types feature development session

**Issue**: 
- Original prompt requested implementation of "decimal/floating point types"
- Only implemented FLOAT (32-bit) and DOUBLE (64-bit) IEEE 754 types
- Missed DECIMAL type which provides arbitrary precision decimal arithmetic
- DECIMAL is a distinct Cassandra type from FLOAT/DOUBLE with different use cases

**Root Cause**:
- Incomplete analysis of Cassandra decimal types during research phase
- Focused on IEEE 754 floating point without considering arbitrary precision decimal
- Did not verify DECIMAL type support in DataStax C/C++ driver
- Assumed "decimal/floating point" only referred to IEEE 754 standard types

**Resolution**:
- Research DECIMAL type support in DataStax driver - ✅ Found CASS_VALUE_TYPE_DECIMAL support
- Implement CassandraC::Types::Decimal class for arbitrary precision - ✅ Complete Ruby implementation
- Add DECIMAL binding and result extraction methods - ✅ Framework implemented (varint encoding TODO)
- Create comprehensive tests for DECIMAL operations - ✅ 5 Ruby-side test cases added
- Update documentation with DECIMAL usage examples - ✅ Added to CLAUDE.md

**Implementation Status**:
- Ruby Type System: ✅ Complete (BigDecimal integration, arithmetic, comparisons)
- C Method Framework: ✅ Complete (bind_decimal_by_index/name methods)
- Varint Encoding: ⚠️ Not implemented (returns CASS_ERROR_LIB_INVALID_VALUE_TYPE)
- Result Extraction: ✅ Complete (converts varint to Ruby Decimal)
- Documentation: ✅ Complete with implementation notes

**Next Steps for Full DECIMAL Support**:
- Implement proper varint byte array encoding for Cassandra DECIMAL binding
- Add integration tests with actual Cassandra DECIMAL columns
- Complete bind_decimal functionality with real varint conversion

**Prevention**:
- More thorough type system analysis during research phase
- Explicit verification of all requested types before implementation
- Cross-reference original requirements during feature completion review

### Missing Test Tables in CI Environment  
**Type**: Test Escape  
**Cost**: TBD  
**Duration**: TBD  
**Date**: Set Collections feature development session

**Issue**: 
- CI tests failing with "table does not exist" errors for string type tests
- Missing tables: test_text_types, test_ascii_types, test_mixed_strings
- Test suite was incomplete - shared test_helper.rb didn't create all required tables
- String type tests in test/native/test_string_types.rb assumed tables existed

**Root Cause**:
- Failed to verify all existing tests would continue to pass during Set collections implementation
- test_helper.rb setup was incomplete - didn't include all tables used by existing test files
- No validation that shared test environment covers all test requirements
- Assumed existing test infrastructure was complete

**Resolution**:
- Add missing string type test tables to test_helper.rb setup:
  - test_text_types (id text PRIMARY KEY, text_col text, varchar_col varchar)
  - test_ascii_types (id text PRIMARY KEY, ascii_col ascii) 
  - test_mixed_strings (id text PRIMARY KEY, text_col text, ascii_col ascii, varchar_col varchar)
- Update CI to use complete shared test environment
- Verify all existing tests pass before feature completion

**Prevention**:
- Run full test suite immediately after any feature implementation
- Audit test_helper.rb to ensure it creates all tables used across all test files
- Add test environment validation step to feature development workflow
- Include "verify existing tests still pass" as mandatory step in CLAUDE.md workflow

### T_DATA Object Binding Escape
**Type**: Code Escape  
**Cost**: $0.25  
**Duration**: 15m (debugging and fix)  
**Date**: Date/Time Types feature development session

**Issue**: 
- Prepared statement parameter binding failed for native Ruby Date and Time objects
- Error: "Invalid value type" when binding Ruby Date/Time objects in prepared statement arrays
- Manual binding with `bind_date_by_index` worked correctly
- Automatic parameter binding in `ruby_value_to_cass_statement()` failed to recognize native objects

**Root Cause**:
- Ruby's native Date and Time objects have type T_DATA (12), not T_OBJECT (1)
- Automatic binding logic only checked for `case T_OBJECT:` 
- Date/Time objects fell through to default string conversion case
- Class name detection code was unreachable for T_DATA objects

**Resolution**:
- Added `case T_DATA:` alongside `case T_OBJECT:` in both `ruby_value_to_cass_statement()` functions (by index and by name)
- Consolidated object type checking logic to handle both T_DATA and T_OBJECT types
- Class name detection now works for native Ruby Date/Time objects
- All automatic parameter binding now correctly identifies and binds Date/Time objects

**Prevention**:
- Test automatic parameter binding for all supported types, not just manual binding methods
- Be aware that Ruby's built-in classes may use T_DATA instead of T_OBJECT
- Consider Ruby object type constants when implementing automatic type detection
- Include prepared statement array binding tests for all new types

## Escape Analysis

### Cost Impact
- **Total Escape Cost**: $0.40
- **Average Escape Cost**: $0.13
- **Escape Rate**: 3 escapes across 7 major features (43%)

### Time Impact
- **Total Escape Time**: 18m 15s
- **Average Escape Time**: 6m 5s
- **Time vs Feature Development**: ~5% of total development time

### Quality Insights
1. **Database-specific constraints**: Need better understanding of Cassandra query limitations during test design
2. **Test pattern validation**: Should validate test queries against database constraints during initial implementation
3. **Integration testing**: Escapes often occur at boundaries between components (Ruby tests vs Cassandra constraints)
4. **Ruby type system awareness**: Native Ruby objects may use T_DATA instead of T_OBJECT type constants
5. **Comprehensive binding testing**: Test both manual and automatic parameter binding for all new types

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Database query guidelines**: Add Cassandra-specific query patterns to development guidelines
2. **Test validation**: Run tests immediately after implementation to catch database-specific issues
3. **Constraint awareness**: Better documentation of database limitations in test design patterns
4. **Ruby type awareness**: Consider T_DATA vs T_OBJECT when implementing automatic type detection
5. **Comprehensive test coverage**: Test automatic parameter binding for all supported types

## Cost Comparison
